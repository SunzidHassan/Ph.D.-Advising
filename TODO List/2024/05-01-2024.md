### Simulation Env

- Trim the image names
  - Template: x-y-yaw_indicator-vision.png
- Trim the olfaction data
  - Olfaction data should contain:
    - Global Wind Direction: using the one where the robot facing forward 
    - Global Wind Speed: using the one where the robot facing forward
    - Chemical Concentration: depending on the direction
  - Template: x-y-yaw_indicator-olfaction.csv
- Save vision and olfaction after trim into a folder, call it meta data.




- Create an image to demonstrate the grid positions
