## Simulation environment for building and testing navigation algorithm.
### Simulation environment
- Gazebo simulation environment

### Plume sensing
- Found airflow sensor, but not chemical sensor.

### Robot
#### Alternative 1: Turtlebot4 simulation.
Turtlebot4 has a preinstalled depth camera. 
- Run Turtlebot4 simulation in your laptop.
- Create a dockerfile for complete environment setup.

### Simulation type
- VLM based vision-only navigation.

## Real world experiment for paper.
### Alternative 1: Use Turtlebot4.
### Alternative 2: Attach depth camera to Turtlebot3.
