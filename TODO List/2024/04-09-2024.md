### Main Research Goal
- Fuse vision and olfaction to find the odor source.
- Vision: use a camera to detect objects from the environment and use a LLM to identify which object is a possible odor source.
  - Problem 1: universal object detector (to extract objects from the observed images)
  - Problem 2: determine extracted object positions (less important) -> we will have a better search trajectory
- Olfaction: guide the robot to approach the odor source location when no valid visual targets are available.
  - Solve it with moth-inspired method

### Task 1: Write a research plan (in few sentences) to filfull the main research goal.
- How to solve the problem 1?
  - Approach 1 - image classification: provide an image and a list of objects to CLIP VLM. CLIP assigns probability scores with each object in the list. It assigns greater probability to the object it considers to be represented in the image.
  - Approach 2 - semantic segmentation: provide an image and a list of objects to CLIPSeg VLM. If we provide a list of n objects to CLIPSeg, it generates n copies of the image - one for each object in the lsit. Each copy includes a segmentation mask of the objects, i.e., each copy masks the portion of the image with that object.
  - Approach 3 - image captioning or visual question answering: provide an image to visual question answering (VQA) model (e.g., BLIP or BLIP-2). The model can generate a caption for the image, or answer question about the image.
- How to solve the problem 2?
  - Approach 1 - object grounding using depth camera: depth camera publishes point cloud indicating distances of objects in the visual field. I am yet to find out how to use the data to ground objects.

  - Approach 2 - using 2-D LiDAR and RGB camera: https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/17/5782
- Do you have better framework in the vision branch?

### Task 2: Create a Simulation Environment to Evaluate Robotic OSL
- Goal 1: a rectangular environment with one odor source and multiple other objects
  - Problem 1: find a library for other 3D realistic objects
  - Problem 2: robotic agent itself (sensors, controls, sensor feedbacks)
- Goal 2: plume simulation in the simulation environment
  - Problem 1: how to simulate plume movements in this simulation environment? (Gaden Maybe? Use Real-world plume data maybe?)
