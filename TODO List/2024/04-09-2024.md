### Main Research Goal
- Fuse vision and olfaction to find the odor source.
- Vision: use a camera to detect objects from the environment and use a LLM to identify which object is a possible odor source.
  - Problem 1: universal object detector (to extract objects from the observed images)
  - Problem 2: determine extracted object positions (less important) -> we will have a better search trajectory
- Olfaction: guide the robot to approach the odor source location when no valid visual targets are available.
  - Solve it with moth-inspired method

### Task 1: Write a research plan (in few sentences) to filfull the main research goal.
- How to solve the problem 1?
  -   
- How to solve the problem 2?
  - 
- In steps
  - Step 1:    

- Do you have better framework in the vision branch?

### Task 2: Create a Simulation Environment to Evaluate Robotic OSL
- Goal 1: a rectangular environment with one odor source and multiple other objects
  - Problem 1: find a library for other 3D realistic objects
  - Problem 2: robotic agent itself (sensors, controls, sensor feedbacks)
- Goal 2: plume simulation in the simulation environment
  - Problem 1: how to simulate plume movements in this simulation environment? (Gaden Maybe? Use Real-world plume data maybe?)
